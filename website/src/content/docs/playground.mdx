template: doc

import Playground from '../../components/Playground.astro';

Try writing Ferret code directly in your browser! The playground features:

- **Full syntax highlighting** for Ferret keywords, types, and operators
- **Monaco Editor** - the same editor that powers VS Code
- **Theme support** - automatically matches your dark/light preference
- **Example code** - click "Load Example" to see sample Ferret programs

:::tip
Use `Ctrl/Cmd + Space` for autocomplete and `Ctrl/Cmd + /` to toggle comments!

## Next Steps

- Learn the [Ferret syntax](/language/variables/)
- Check out [examples](/getting-started/hello-world/)
- Read the [language guide](/language/variables/)

:::note
Code execution is coming soon! For now, enjoy syntax highlighting and code editing. We're working on integrating the Ferret compiler for real-time execution.
